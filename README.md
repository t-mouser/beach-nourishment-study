# Beach Nourishment Model and Field Study
This file explains how to use this code to model nourishment efficiency in alongshore paired communities, as well as the field study conducted along the New Jersey coastline in the journal submission entitle *From Coastal Retreat to Seaward Growth: Emergent Behaviors from Paired Community Beach Nourishment Choices* by J. Lorenzo-Trueba<sup>1</sup>, A. Janoff<sup>2</sup>, O. Thomas<sup>2</sup>, P. Hoagland<sup>3</sup>, D. Jin<sup>3</sup>, and A. Ashton<sup>4</sup>.

## Model Code
There is a main code directory for the model, entitled >maincode> with a subdirectory for figures and data files. The model is coded in MatLab. Please see the documentation in this directory for how to run this code.

## Field Study Code
There is field study code for the field study portion of the manuscript in a directory entitle >field study>. This code is in Python along with associated data files. Please see the documentation in this directory for how to run this code.
